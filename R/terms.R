#' Topic Terms, Retuned Without Refitting
#'
#' Recomputes the ranked terms of a fitted topic model under different term
#' settings. Term extraction depends only on the fitted topic assignments and
#' the document text, so every argument here can be changed without repeating
#' the clustering or the encoding.
#'
#' @param x A fitted model from [topics()].
#' @param n Terms returned per topic, or `NULL` for the whole vocabulary
#'   (useful together with `smoothing` to obtain a full \eqn{p(term | topic)}
#'   distribution). Defaults to the model's fitted `n_terms`.
#' @param stop_words Character vector excluded from terms. Defaults to the
#'   model's fitted list; see [stop_words()].
#' @param min_term_frequency Minimum corpus-wide token frequency.
#' @param min_token_length Minimum Unicode character length for a token.
#' @param weighting Class-based term weighting, `"ctfidf"` or `"bm25"`.
#' @param reduce_frequent_words Square-root the within-topic frequency before
#'   weighting, damping very frequent words.
#' @param stem Collapse inflected forms onto a shared Porter stem, displaying
#'   the most frequent surface form. Requires `SnowballC`.
#' @param numbers How to treat purely numeric tokens: `"keep"` or `"remove"`
#'   (drop digit-only tokens such as years and counts). Defaults to the model's
#'   fitted setting.
#' @param roman_numerals How to treat Roman-numeral tokens: `"keep"` or
#'   `"remove"` (drop chapter/section markers such as `ii`, `iv`, up to 100).
#'   Defaults to the model's fitted setting.
#' @param section_numbers How to treat section, reference, and list numbering —
#'   multi-level indices such as `1.2.3` and enumeration markers such as `1.`,
#'   `2.`: `"keep"` or `"remove"`. Defaults to the model's fitted setting.
#' @param smoothing Additive (Dirichlet) smoothing for the `beta` column. Only
#'   terms a topic actually used are returned, so with `smoothing = 0`
#'   (default) each topic's `beta` sums to one, while any positive value
#'   reserves mass for the zero-count vocabulary and the returned rows sum to
#'   less than one.
#' @param sort_by Order terms within each topic by `"score"` (default, the
#'   class-based weight — distinctive words) or `"beta"` (raw \eqn{p(term | topic)}
#'   — the words the topic uses most). `n` is applied after ordering.
#' @param ... Unused, present for generic consistency.
#' @return A base data frame with one row per topic and term: `topic`,
#'   `label`, `term`, `rank`, `score` (the class-based weight), `frequency`
#'   (within-topic count), and `beta`, the multinomial \eqn{p(term | topic)}.
