# Score Topic Coherence

Computes intrinsic topic coherence from the top terms of a fitted topic
model and the co-occurrence structure of the input documents. Coherence
rewards topics whose top terms tend to appear together in the same
documents, and is the standard quantitative measure for embedding-based
topic models (Mimno et al. 2011).

## Usage

``` r
coherence(
  object,
  measure = c("npmi", "umass"),
  n_terms = 10L,
  smoothing = 1,
  token_lists = NULL,
  cores = 1L
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An \`sbert_topic_model\` returned by \[topics()\].

- measure:

  Either \`"umass"\` (Mimno et al. 2011; larger, i.e. closer to zero, is
  more coherent) or \`"npmi"\` (normalized pointwise mutual information,
  bounded in \`\[-1, 1\]\`; larger is more coherent).

- n_terms:

  Number of top terms per topic to score. Capped at the number of terms
  actually available for each topic.

- smoothing:

  Additive smoothing for the UMass co-occurrence count.

- token_lists:

  Optional precomputed per-document token lists, aligned to
  \`object\$documents\`, that skip re-tokenizing the corpus (as produced
  by \[topic_corpus()\]). Leave \`NULL\` to tokenize internally; the
  score is identical either way.

- cores:

  Number of forked worker processes for tokenization when it is not
  already cached. Default \`1\` (serial). Values above one use
  \`parallel::mclapply\` on Unix-alikes and fall back to serial
  elsewhere; the result is identical regardless of the count.

## Value

A data frame with one row per topic and columns \`topic\`, \`label\`,
\`measure\`, \`n_terms\`, and \`coherence\`. The corpus-level mean is
attached as the \`"mean_coherence"\` attribute. Topics with fewer than
two scorable terms yield \`NA\`.

## Examples

``` r
text <- c(
  "Cats chase mice", "Dogs chase balls",
  "Stocks and bonds trade", "Markets price shares"
)
embeddings <- rbind(c(1, 0), c(0.9, 0.1), c(0, 1), c(0.1, 0.9))
topics <- topics(text, 2, embeddings = embeddings, n_terms = 3)
coherence(topics)
