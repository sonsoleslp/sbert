# Reduce a Fitted Topic Model to Fewer Topics

Cuts the topic topic_hierarchy (see \[topic_hierarchy()\]) at the
requested count and rebuilds the model: documents keep their cluster
memberships (merged, never re-clustered), centroids are recomputed from
the member documents, and terms, labels, sizes, and representatives are
derived afresh for the merged topics. The result is a full
\`sbert_topic_model\` — every downstream verb (\`summary()\`,
\`coherence()\`, \`predict()\`, \[representatives()\], plots) works
unchanged.

## Usage

``` r
reduce_topics(object, n_topics, embeddings = NULL, method = "average")
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An \`sbert_topic_model\` returned by \[topics()\].

- n_topics:

  Target number of topics, at least 2 and below the current count.

- embeddings:

  The document embedding matrix used to fit \`object\`. Only needed when
  the model was fitted with \`keep_embeddings = FALSE\`; models fitted
  with \`keep_embeddings = TRUE\` carry their embeddings.

- method:

  Agglomeration method passed to \[stats::hclust()\]. Default
  \`"average"\`.

## Value

An \`sbert_topic_model\` with \`n_topics\` topics.

## Examples

``` r
text <- c(
  "Cats chase mice", "Dogs chase balls", "Kittens nap in sunshine",
  "Stocks and bonds trade", "Markets price shares", "Banks report profit"
)
embeddings <- rbind(
  c(1, 0), c(0.95, 0.05), c(0.9, 0.1),
  c(0, 1), c(0.05, 0.95), c(0.1, 0.9)
)
topics <- topics(
  text, 3,
  embeddings = embeddings, n_terms = 3, keep_embeddings = TRUE
)
reduce_topics(topics, 2)
#> <sbert_topic_model>
#>   documents: 6 
#>   topics: 2
#>   model: precomputed embeddings
#>   algorithm: hierarchical merge of deterministic k-means topics
#>   topic sizes: 3, 3
#>   between/total SS: 99.5%
```
