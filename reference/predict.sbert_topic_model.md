# Assign New Documents to Fitted Topics

Predicts the topic of unseen documents by embedding them and assigning
each to the nearest stored topic centroid under cosine distance. The
fitted model is not modified. Supply either a loaded \`model\` (to embed
\`text\`) or a precomputed embedding matrix whose rows align with
\`text\`.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'sbert_topic_model'
predict(object, text, model = NULL, embeddings = NULL, batch_size = 32L, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A fitted \[topics()\] model.

- text:

  Character vector of new documents. A model fitted with \`segment =
  "sentence"\`, \`"clause"\`, or \`"phrase"\` splits them the same way
  first (with the fitted \`max_tokens\`, \`merge_below\`, and
  \`min_content\`) and assigns every segment.

- model:

  A loaded \[sbert_model\]\[load_model()\], a pinned model name, or
  \`NULL\` for the default model; ignored when \`embeddings\` are
  supplied. The embedding dimension must match the fitted model.

- embeddings:

  Optional numeric matrix with one row per document, or one row per
  segment for a segmented model.

- batch_size:

  Batch size passed to \[encode()\] when \`model\` is used.

- ...:

  Unused; included for S3 compatibility.

## Value

A base data frame with one row per document and columns \`document_id\`,
\`document_name\`, \`text\`, \`topic\`, \`label\` (the fitted topic
label), and \`distance\` (cosine distance to the assigned centroid). For
a segmented model, one row per segment, with \`document_id\` naming the
source document and \`segment\` its position within it.

## Examples

``` r
text <- c(
  "Cats chase mice", "Dogs chase balls",
  "Stocks and bonds trade", "Markets price shares"
)
embeddings <- rbind(c(1, 0), c(0.9, 0.1), c(0, 1), c(0.1, 0.9))
fitted <- topics(text, 2, embeddings = embeddings)
predict(fitted, "Bulls and bears move markets", embeddings = rbind(c(0.2, 0.8)))
#>   document_id document_name                         text topic
#> 1           1               Bulls and bears move markets     2
#>                     label   distance
#> 1 bonds / markets / price 0.01792973
```
