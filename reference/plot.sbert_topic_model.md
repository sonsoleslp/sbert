# Plot a Semantic Topic Model

Draws one of five deterministic base-graphics views of a fitted topic
model.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'sbert_topic_model'
plot(
  x,
  type = c("sizes", "terms", "representatives", "fit", "map"),
  by = "score",
  topics = NULL,
  per_topic = FALSE,
  n_terms = 8L,
  n_representatives = 5L,
  colors = topic_palette(nrow(x$topics)),
  max_points = 1500L,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An \`sbert_topic_model\` returned by \[topics()\].

- type:

  One of \`"sizes"\` (document count per topic), \`"terms"\` (top terms
  per topic), \`"representatives"\` (a ranked text list of the
  centroid-nearest documents per topic), \`"fit"\` (a per-topic report
  with all three term views – count, TF-IDF, beta – followed by the
  representative documents, one row per topic), or \`"map"\` (a
  two-dimensional classical-MDS projection of the document embeddings,
  coloured by topic). The \`"map"\` view requires a model fitted with
  \`keep_embeddings = TRUE\`.

- by:

  For \`type = "terms"\`, one or more of \`"score"\` (class-based
  TF-IDF, the default and most distinctive terms), \`"beta"\` (the
  generative within-topic word probability), and \`"frequency"\` (the
  raw within-topic count). A single value draws one panel per topic;
  several values draw one row per topic with a column for each metric.

- topics:

  For \`type\` \`"terms"\`, \`"representatives"\`, or \`"fit"\`, an
  optional vector of topic numbers to restrict the plot to. Defaults to
  all topics.

- per_topic:

  For \`type\` \`"terms"\`, \`"representatives"\`, or \`"fit"\`, draw a
  separate figure for each topic instead of arranging all topics into
  one gridded figure. Most useful with a device or \`knitr\` chunk that
  keeps every figure (each topic then becomes its own image).

- n_terms:

  Number of top terms shown per panel when \`type\` is \`"terms"\` or
  \`"fit"\`.

- n_representatives:

  Number of representative documents shown per panel when \`type\` is
  \`"representatives"\` or \`"fit"\`. When more are requested than the
  model stored at fit time, they are recomputed from the retained
  embeddings; if the model was fitted with \`keep_embeddings = FALSE\`,
  the stored set is used and a warning is issued.

- colors:

  Optional vector of topic colours; defaults to \[topic_palette()\].

- max_points:

  Maximum documents drawn when \`type = "map"\`. Larger corpora are
  thinned to a deterministic stratified subsample so the classical-MDS
  projection stays tractable.

- ...:

  Unused; present for S3 compatibility.

## Value

Invisibly, \`x\`.

## Examples

``` r
text <- c(
  "Cats chase mice", "Dogs chase balls",
  "Stocks and bonds trade", "Markets price shares",
  "Neural nets learn patterns", "Models train on data"
)
embeddings <- rbind(
  c(1, 0, 0), c(0.9, 0.1, 0),
  c(0, 1, 0), c(0.1, 0.9, 0),
  c(0, 0, 1), c(0.05, 0, 0.95)
)
topics <- topics(text, 3, embeddings = embeddings, keep_embeddings = TRUE)
plot(topics, type = "sizes")

plot(topics, type = "terms")

plot(topics, type = "terms", by = "frequency")

plot(topics, type = "terms", by = c("frequency", "score", "beta"), topics = 1)

plot(topics, type = "representatives")

plot(topics, type = "fit")

plot(topics, type = "fit", per_topic = TRUE)



plot(topics, type = "map")
```
